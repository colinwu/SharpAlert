- Can use .where, .joins, .group, .order etc methods with .paginate. Just make sure .paginate is last in the chain.

New model:
Device
 ... has_many Alerts
 ... has_one NotifyControl
 ... belongs_to Client
 
Client
 ... has_many Devices
 
Alerts
 ... belongs_to Device

- using .joins method will result in missing records in views; e.g. When a new device is first detected it will not have a client associated with it (i.e. it's client_id field will be nil). Such device will not appear in the device list if the controller uses Device.joins(:client) to generate the list. Instead use Deivce.find(:include => :client). It's the difference between inner and outer join. 

Handling RED attachments
- use ripmime utility (in a Procmail recipe) to extract the attachments.
- "Jam Trouble Data" attachment file format:

Start  Length  Description
0x00      15   "JAM TROUBLE HIS"
0x10      01   Part code (always 0x05 for Jam)
0x11      01   Message Cause (need to find out what these mean)
0x12      16   zero-padded model name (e.g. "MX-2300N" 0x00 0x00 0x00 ...)
0x22      10   Serial number
0x32      06   Hex encoded sent date and time; i.e. 0x13 0x08 0x15 
               0x10 0x01 0x25 represnts "Aug 15, 2013 10:01:25"
0x38      02   Number of DF jam history records in file. 

Number of MB history records is immediately after DF history records.
Number of trouble history records is immediately after MB history records.

Each DF and MB record is 20 bytes long:
0x00      02   Jam Code
0x02      06   Date of Jam record
0x08      01   Paper Code
0x09      01   Paper Type Code
0x0a      02   '0xffff'
0x0c      04   BW valid output counter
0x10      04   Colour valid output counter

Use the "sent date" (ignoring seconds field) to find appropriate DF or MB record from which to extract the jam code

Extract the current total bw and colour counters from "E-mail DIAG Job Counter Data.R08" file.
=======================
process_alert_status.rb

New process:
- all alert attachments should be extracted into a temp directory by 'ripmime'
- if 'textfile1' exists then it contains the plain-text portion of the message; i.e. the alert message itself
- if 'textfile1' does not exist then 'textfile0' contains the message
- if the alert is for a misfeed then process the '*.R05' file to obtain the jam code
=======================

Predicting toner use - Simple average method on dates
- Only look at toner alerts that are at least 5 days apart
- Examine "toner low" and "toner out" alerts separately
