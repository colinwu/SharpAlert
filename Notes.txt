- Can use .where, .joins, .group, .order etc methods with .paginate. Just make sure .paginate is last in the chain.

New model:
Device
 ... has_many Alerts
 ... has_one NotifyControl
 ... belongs_to Client
 
Client
 ... has_many Devices
 
Alerts
 ... belongs_to Device

- using .joins method will result in missing records in views; e.g. When a new device is first detected it will not have a client associated with it (i.e. it's client_id field will be nil). Such device will not appear in the device list if the controller uses Device.join(:client) to generate the list. Instead use Deivce.find(:include => :client). It's the difference between inner and outer join.
