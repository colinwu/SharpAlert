Do we need to have authentication where users are only allowed to see/modify clients and devices assigned to them?

There would have to be at least one "super user" who can do everything. This is necessary, at the very least, to handle new devices and create new clients.

Each client will need an admin_id column. (Can there ever be more than one admin per client?)

Will devices (and controls) need an admin_id as well? Test.

Simpler solution: allow only the logged-in user (super user) to make changes. Everyone else can only view.

May need to add a column for "received timestamp" to both alert and counter tables. Some printers do not have the correct time. Is it reasonable to expect all printers to be synchronised to a SNTP server? There are plenty of public ones and any printer that's networked should be.

============= DONE =============
Use fetchmail to download email messages from dha@sharpsec.com rather than having the mail server (sharpmail.sharpamericas.com) forward them. Paul thinks this will keep it under IT's radar.

fetchmail options to use:
-k
  keep retrieved messages on the mail server

-p IMAP
  Protocol to use to talk to the mail server
  
--fetchlimit <number>
  For testing only - limits the number of messges fetched from the mail server per connection.
  
-u <username>

---------------------------
.fetchmailrc file

# Specify mail server to poll for new messages
poll sharpmail.sharpamericas.com
  protocol IMAP
  # Deliver new messages from user "dha" to local user "sharpmon" and
  # leave message on the server
  user "dha" with password "W3lcome1" there is "sharpmon" here keep
# Put into daemon mode, polling every 300 seconds (5 min)
# set daemon 300
# Direct error mail to the local postmaster
set no bouncemail
# Keep undeliverable messages on the server
set softbounce
# Use syslog
set syslog

---------------------------
Plan:

- Access DHA inbox with Thunderbird
- Delete all "Mail Delivery System" messages
- Mark all messages as read
- Disable redirect rule on DHA inbox
- TO TEST: 
    - run fetchmail manually once DHA has received one new alert
    - see if it shows up in RED db
- start fetchmail on RED server
- make sure fetchmail will automatically start on reboot - use cron instead of daemon

============= TODO ==============
Handle different languages

Most likely languages we need to worry about are English and French. Where do we need care? 
- both process_*_email.rb programs.
- wherever we search for, or process alert messages

============= TODO ==============
Do something to predict when toner needs to be added based on past usage. Must have at least two data points (i.e. two "add toner" alerts). Predict using linear regression.

* Can not assume there will always be an "Add toner" alert. Some people *may* change
  toner cartridge before that point. 
* There *should* always be at least one "toner supply is low" alert.
