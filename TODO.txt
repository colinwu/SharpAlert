Do we need to have authentication where users are only allowed to see/modify clients and devices assigned to them?

There would have to be at least one "super user" who can do everything. This is necessary, at the very least, to handle new devices and create new clients.

Each client will need an admin_id column. (Can there ever be more than one admin per client?)

Will devices (and controls) need an admin_id as well? Test.

Simpler solution: allow only the logged-in user (super user) to make changes. Everyone else can only view.

May need to add a column for "received timestamp" to both alert and counter tables. Some printers do not have the correct time. Is it reasonable to expect all printers to be synchronised to a SNTP server? There are plenty of public ones and any printer that's networked should be.
